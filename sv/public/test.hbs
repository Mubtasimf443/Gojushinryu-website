                                   Shihan Varun Jettly, is an epitome of strong-willed single minded individual who could only see his objective of rising high in Martial Arts in early stages of his life and  aspired to become an International Coach and Referee after competing in hundreds of championships at national and international level.
                                   <br>
                                   Shihan Varun Jettly was born in India with a fire in the belly to learn Martial Arts and at the age of eight he started searching for Karate Classes. As he was born in small town (in mid of 1980’s), the Martial Arts in his area were not prevalent. He could not find any Martial Arts Academy but Shihan Varun Jettly had some idea after watching Bruce Lee movies, so he kept punching and kicking in the nearby railway ground but he was still searching for a Martial Arts Teacher who can teach and brush his skills. In Year 1995, at the age of 10, he found a Karate (one form of Martial Arts) Classes, he joined them after pursuing his mother for days and days as his mother was a very protective mother and like everybody else she would think that my son will get hurt. After that there was no lokking back for him. 
                                   <br>
                                   Shihan Varun Jettly put in backbreaking work in all his moves, punches kicks, Katas and fights. He strived for excellence every day in his Karate Class. He would keep punching and kicking for hours and hours in hot harsh afternoons. He played state and national level championships where he 4excelled. He showed hardcore demonstrations where a big thick wooden log was hit on his shoulder, stomach, thighs, Calf leg, arms and the log used to break in two pieces. The large crowd used to gather for his such demonstrations. (Photos of demonstration attached) Not everybody is capable of such a talent. There is always a huge risk involved in such demonstrations because a person can paralyse after got hit at the wrong spot especially on the shoulder.
